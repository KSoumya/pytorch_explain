PYTORCH EXPLAIN DOCUMENTATION
===============================

`PyTorch, Explain!` is an extension library for PyTorch to develop explainable deep learning models.

It consists of various methods for explainability from a variety of published papers, including the APIs
required to get first-order logic explanations from deep neural networks.

Quick start
-----------

You can install Deep Logic along with all its dependencies from
`PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/torch_explain/>`__:

.. code:: bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt torch_explain


Experiments
------------

Training
~~~~~~~~~~

To train the model(s) in the paper, run the scripts and notebooks inside the folder `experiments`.

Results
~~~~~~~~~~

Results on test set and logic formulas will be saved in the folder `experiments/results`.

Data
~~~~~~~~~~

The original datasets can be downloaded from the links provided in the supplementary material of the paper.
